          Who Is Eminem?
          <br>
          Rapper, actor and music producer Eminem is one of the best-selling musicians of the 21st century and one of the most influential rappers of all time.
          <br> <br>
          Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in 1972 in Missouri, Eminem had a turbulent childhood. He dropped out of school in the ninth grade and worked odd jobs until finally making it as a rapper upon the release of,
          <br> <br>
          The Slim Shady LP in early 1999. The album went multi-platinum, garnering Eminem two Grammy Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards.
          <br> <br>
          In 2000, Eminem released The Marshall Mathers LP, which was noted as the fastest-selling album in rap history. Two years later, he delivered the Academy Award-winning song "Lose Yourself," from the semi-autobiographical drama 8 Mile.
          <br> <br>
          In 2010, he released the Grammy-winning album Recovery, a highly autobiographical attempt to come to terms with his struggles with addiction and experience with rehabilitation.
          <br> <br>
          The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013) also garnered numerous accolades, and the rapper later followed with Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be Murdered By (2020).

          <p>
            I admire Eminem because he's a lyricial genius. 
            He makes metaphor after metaphor and references absurd things that make his music that much better. 
            In addition to this his opinion is never swaying, he remains strong willed and determined to his thoughts. 
            He also struggled through many things I feel make him that much stronger and also help me relate to him.
